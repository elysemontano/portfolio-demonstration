      <h1 className='padding'>About Me</h1>
      <p className='padding'>I am a web development instructor and software developer with experience writing and teaching full stack applications in Ruby on Rails and React, utilizing Javascript, HTML and CSS with an eagerness to continue learning new technologies and stacks. I have a passion to teach and write web applications utilizing efficient collaboration and industry best practices. With a background of six years in live sound engineering, I really enjoyed troubleshooting, thinking outside the box, and working creatively and collaboratively to solve problems and produce a high quality standard. I love that teaching and software development encompasses all of those things that I loved in live sound, using problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity to bring the best to both projects and the classroom.</p>
